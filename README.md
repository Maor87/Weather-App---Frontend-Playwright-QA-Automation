# Playwright QA Automation for Weather App

## Project Overview

This project represents my **first independent automation testing project**, A **Weather App** developed by **Fullstack Developer Eden Gilady**. 
As a QA Tester, my primary objective was to implement automation testing for the application's user interface (UI) and functional aspects, along with thorough responsive layout testing across devices. 
This project showcases my ability to independently design, execute, and report on comprehensive automation test cycles.

## Key Testing Activities & Accomplishments

During this freelance project, I undertook the following critical testing responsibilities and achieved significant outcomes:

* **Functional / UI Testing:** I designed and executed Playwright test scripts to validate all user-facing functionalities and UI elements of the weather application.
* This included verifying search bar functionality, accurate weather data display (temperature, conditions, etc.), and overall user interaction flows.
* **Responsive Layout Testing:** A key focus was ensuring the application's adaptability and optimal user experience across different screen sizes.
* I performed responsive layout testing to confirm the app's visual and functional behavior on both **desktop/laptop** and **mobile device** resolutions.
* **Individual Test Suite & Test Script Execution:** Each **Test Suite** and individual **Test Script** was systematically executed and inspected using **Playwright Inspector**.
* This allowed for isolation of issues, and verification of expected outcomes for each test component.
* **Comprehensive Test Documentation & Reporting:** I created and maintained detailed **Test Documentation**, which included clearly defined **test cases**.
* Upon completion of testing phases, I compiled a **Test Summary Report**. These documents provide a overview of the testing efforts, including coverage, findings.
* You can view the full documentation here: (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10b1DC__HNyE10vrPXHzMg4xkEEoDFjoZmgtP4OVSn7E/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
* **Effective Bug Reporting:** I identified, documented, and reported **Bug Reports** for any defects discovered.
* Each report included clear steps to reproduce, actual versus expected results, and relevant evidence such as screenshots, facilitating communication by the developer.


## Technologies and Tools Used

My independent work on this project leveraged a combination of powerful tools and resources:

* **Playwright:** The core automation framework used for UI and functional tests.
* **JavaScript:** The primary programming language uesed for writing all Playwright test scripts and managing the test automation codebase.
* **Playwright Inspector:** An indispensable tool used for inspecting web elements, and interactively developing locators and assertions.
* **VS Code:** My integrated development environment (IDE) of choice, providing a robust platform for writing, managing, automation code.
* **Git Bash Terminal:** Used for executing Git commands, managing version control operations (commits, pushes), and running Playwright tests from the command line.
* **GitHub:** Employed for version control, hosting the test automation repository, and collaborating effectively by tracking changes and managing the codebase history.
* **Gemini Advanced AI:** Leveraged as a powerful assistant for debugging and resolving coding mistakes.
* **Playwright Documentation:** Regularly consulted the official Playwright documentation to discover,
* understand, and implement various functions, methods, and best practices for creating effective test scripts and test suites.
